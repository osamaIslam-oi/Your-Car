## Features
1-Responsive Design
YouCar is built with a responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing and interactive experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

2-Local Storage
The application leverages local storage to save user preferences, selected cars, and other relevant data. This allows users to seamlessly resume their car-buying journey even after closing the browser.

3-React Hooks
YouCar utilizes the power of React hooks to manage stateful logic efficiently. Hooks such as useState and useEffect contribute to a clean and organized codebase.

4-React Multi Carousel
The car browsing experience is enhanced with the use of react-multi-carousel. This carousel component offers a visually appealing and interactive way for users to explore different car models.

5-React Use Cart
YouCar utilizes the `react-use-cart` library to simplify and manage shopping cart functionality in the application. This library provides a set of React hooks and utilities to handle common shopping cart operations, making it easy to integrate and maintain the cart-related state.
